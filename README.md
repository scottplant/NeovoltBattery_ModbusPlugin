## ⚠️ Upgrading to v2 release from v1

This update significantly changes the battery control model. The previous multi-entity charge/discharge controls have been replaced by a single **Dispatch Mode** selector with supporting number entities. Any automations referencing the old control entities will need to be updated. If you need to keep the previous behaviour temporarily, stay on v1.0.8 — however, no further development will occur on that version.

---

## 🎯 What Does This Integration Do?

This integration connects your Neovolt inverter to Home Assistant, giving you:

- **Real-time monitoring** of solar production, battery status, and grid usage
- **Full battery control** via a single Dispatch Mode selector
- **Dynamic Export and Dynamic Import modes** for automatic grid power management
- **Energy tracking** for the Home Assistant Energy Dashboard
- **Multi-inverter support** with combined sensors for parallel setups
- **Automations** to optimise when your battery charges and discharges

### 🎛️ Battery Control

All battery control flows through a single **Dispatch Mode** selector. Configure the supporting number entities first, then select a mode.

#### Dispatch Mode (Select Entity)

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Normal** | Battery operates automatically based on inverter configuration |
| **Force Charge** | Charges from solar/grid at the configured power until the target SOC is reached |
| **Force Discharge** | Discharges to load/grid at the configured power until the cutoff SOC is reached |
| **Dynamic Export** | Continuously adjusts discharge to maintain grid export at the target level |
| **Dynamic Import** | Continuously adjusts charging to maintain grid import at the target level |
| **No Battery Charge** | Prevents all battery charging (from solar and grid). Will still discharge to loads if needed |
| **Idle (No Dispatch)** | Halts all battery dispatch (charging + discharging) — inverter stays online but battery sits idle |

> **Note:** Selecting **Normal** or pressing the **Stop Force Charge/Discharge** button cancels any active dispatch mode.

#### Dispatch Configuration (Number Entities)

Set these before activating Force Charge, Force Discharge, or Dynamic modes.

| Entity | Range | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Dispatch Power** | 0.5 – max kW | Charge or discharge power (slider max reflects your configured system capacity) |
| **Dispatch Duration** | 1 – 480 min | How long to run the dispatch command |
| **Dispatch Charge Target SOC** | 10 – 100 % | Stop Force Charge when battery reaches this SOC |
| **Dispatch Discharge Cutoff SOC** | 4 – 100 % | Stop Force Discharge when battery falls to this SOC |
| **Dynamic Mode Power Target** | 0.05 – 15 kW | Target export power (Dynamic Export) or target import power (Dynamic Import) |

#### How to Use Force Charge

1. Set **Dispatch Power** to the desired charge rate (e.g. 4 kW).
2. Set **Dispatch Duration** (e.g. 120 minutes).
3. Set **Dispatch Charge Target SOC** to your desired ceiling (e.g. 100 %).
4. Set **Dispatch Mode** → **Force Charge**.

The battery will charge at the specified rate until either the duration expires or the target SOC is reached.

#### How to Use Dynamic Export

Dynamic Export discharges the battery to keep grid export at a constant target level, accounting for varying house load. It re-evaluates every 10 seconds.

1. Set **Dynamic Mode Power Target** to your desired export level in kW (e.g. 5kW to the grid).
2. Set **Dispatch Mode** → **Dynamic Export**.

The integration will automatically adjust discharge power every 10 seconds, with a 0.3 kW debounce to avoid excessive commands.

#### How to Use Dynamic Import

Dynamic Import charges the battery from the grid while holding a target import level. Useful for off-peak tariff charging without overloading the connection.

1. Set **Dynamic Mode Power Target** to the grid import power you want to maintain (e.g. 2 kW).
2. Set **Dispatch Mode** → **Dynamic Import**.

#### Additional Controls

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **PV Switch** (Select) | Control PV input: Auto / Open / Close |
| **Time Period Control** (Select) | *Note - disabled as not currently not working* |
| **Stop Force Charge/Discharge** (Button) | Immediately cancels all active dispatch (including dynamic modes) and returns to Normal |

### ⚙️ System Settings (Number Entities)

| Entity | Range | Register | Description |
|--------|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Max Feed to Grid Power** | 0 – 100 % | 0x0800 | Cap on grid export as a percentage of rated power |
| **Charging Cutoff SOC** | 10 – 100 % | 0x0855 | Maximum SOC the battery will charge to under normal (automatic) operation |
| **Discharging Cutoff SOC (Default)** | 4 – 100 % | 0x0850 | Minimum SOC the battery will discharge to under normal operation |
| **PV Capacity** | 0 – max W | 0x0801 | Total installed PV capacity in Watts (32-bit register) |
| **Grid Power Offset** | −500 – +500 W | 0x11D5 | Signed calibration offset for the grid power reading. Positive values bias toward export/discharge; negative values toward import. Only visible when the firmware exposes this register. |

## 🔄 Multi-Inverter Setup (Parallel / Master-Slave)

### Recommended configuration

1. **Host device** (your master/primary inverter)
   - Device Role: **Host**
   - Set Max Charge/Discharge Power to the **total combined capacity** (e.g. 15 kW for 3 × 5 kW)
   - All control and combined sensor entities appear here

2. **Follower device(s)** (secondary inverters)
   - Device Role: **Follower**
   - Sensor-only — no control entities are created
   - Combined sensors on the Host automatically include follower data once linked

The integration links Host and Follower coordinators automatically after both entries load, regardless of load order. Combined sensors appear on the Host device and aggregate data from both inverters.

---

## ⚙️ Changing Settings After Installation

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services**.
2. Find **Neovolt Inverter**, click **⋮ → Configure**.
3. Step through: Device Role → Power Limits → Polling & Recovery.
4. Click **Submit** — the integration will reload with your new settings.

## 🔌 Connection Troubleshooting

### Direct Ethernet

- Can't find IP: check router device list, use the Fing app, or check the inverter's display.
- Connection refused on port 502: verify Modbus TCP is enabled on the inverter and that port 502 isn't blocked.
- Intermittent connection: assign a static IP in your router's DHCP reservation.

### EW11A

- Can't connect to EW11A hotspot: wait 30 s after power-on; look for a network starting with "EW11".
- EW11A not on home network: verify WiFi credentials, confirm STA mode, and check the router's device list.
- Data errors: verify serial settings are 9600 baud and TCP Server is enabled on port 502.

## ❓ Common Problems

### "Cannot Connect" Error

- Verify the inverter/gateway is powered on and the IP is correct.
- Ping the IP from the Home Assistant Terminal: `ping <IP>`
- Check port 502 is reachable: `telnet <IP> 502`
- Check Home Assistant logs for the detailed error.

### Sensors Show "Unavailable"

- Confirm Slave ID is correct (default: 85).
- Wait a few minutes for the initial poll to complete.
- Reload the integration: Settings → Devices & Services → Neovolt → ⋮ → Reload.
- Enable debug logging and check logs (see below).

### Force Charge / Discharge Not Working

- Check battery SOC is within the allowed range for the chosen mode.
- Confirm the dispatch power is at least 0.5 kW.
- Press **Stop Force Charge/Discharge** first to clear any stuck state, then re-apply.
- Check the **Dispatch Status** sensor for error messages.

### Battery Not Reaching 100 % SOC

This was a bug in earlier versions (SOC register used 0–250 instead of 0–255). It is fixed in v2.0.0. Update to the latest version and ensure **Dispatch Charge Target SOC** is set to 100 %.

### Power Sliders Are Limited

The dispatch power slider maximum is derived from your configured Max Charge/Discharge Power. If you have multiple inverters, update those values via **Configure** (see above).

### Stale Data Warning

The `data_stale` attribute on sensors indicates the integration is using cached data due to a connection issue. Auto-recovery will reconnect automatically. Sensors remain available for up to 12 hours on cached data before becoming unavailable.

## 📝 Enable Debug Logging

Add to `/config/configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.neovolt: debug
    pymodbus: debug
```

Restart Home Assistant, then check **Settings → System → Logs** and search for `neovolt`.

---

## 🔧 Advanced: Optimising Polling

The integration uses adaptive polling — intervals automatically speed up for changing values and slow down for stable ones.

**Slower/less reliable networks:**
```
Min Poll Interval: 15 s
Max Poll Interval: 600 s
Consecutive Failures: 10
Staleness Threshold: 20 min
```

**Fast, reliable networks:**
```
Min Poll Interval: 10 s
Max Poll Interval: 120 s
Consecutive Failures: 3
Staleness Threshold: 5 min
```
